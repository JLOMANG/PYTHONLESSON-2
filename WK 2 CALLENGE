Here are the Python programs for each of your requests:

1. Program to create a list of integers and compute their sum:
```python
# Accept user input to create a list of integers
numbers = input("Enter a list of integers separated by spaces: ").split()
numbers = [int(num) for num in numbers]

# Compute the sum of the integers
total = sum(numbers)
print("The sum of the integers is:", total)
```

2. Program to create a tuple of favorite books and print each on a separate line:
```python
# Create a tuple containing the names of five favorite books
favorite_books = ("To Kill a Mockingbird", "1984", "The Catcher in the Rye", "The Great Gatsby", "Pride and Prejudice")

# Print each book name on a separate line using a for loop
for book in favorite_books:
    print(book)
```

3. Program to store information about a person in a dictionary and print the dictionary:
```python
# Create an empty dictionary to store person's information
person_info = {}

# Ask user for input
person_info['name'] = input("Enter your name: ")
person_info['age'] = input("Enter your age: ")
person_info['favorite_color'] = input("Enter your favorite color: ")

# Print the dictionary
print("Person's information:", person_info)
```

4. Program to create two sets of integers and find their intersection:
```python
# Accept user input to create two sets of integers
set1 = set(map(int, input("Enter integers for the first set separated by spaces: ").split()))
set2 = set(map(int, input("Enter integers for the second set separated by spaces: ").split()))

# Find the intersection of the two sets
common_elements = set1.intersection(set2)
print("Common elements in both sets:", common_elements)
```

5. Program to filter a list of words to contain only those with odd number of characters:
```python
# List of words
words = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "grape", "kiwi", "strawberry", "blueberry"]

# List comprehension to filter words with odd number of characters
odd_length_words = [word for word in words if len(word) % 2 != 0]
print("Words with odd number of characters:", odd_length_words)
```

Feel free to run these programs and let me know if you need further explanation or assistance!
